npm run dev      # Frontend (port 5173)
npm run server   # Backend (port 3001)
```

### Environment Setup
Create `.env` file:
```env
POLYGON_API_KEY=r2WIX7wlHHQNJ8w0aB3gmu9BehbsJ0lZ
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDB3HRUbOBZOvzWRc-6t43jTUdASFWwt0s
PORT=3001
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
USE_REAL_AI=false  # Set to true when Gemini API is working
```

## 🌐 Deployment Ready

### Hosting Options
1. **Frontend**: Vercel/Netlify (Free)
2. **Backend**: Railway/Render ($5/month)
3. **Total Cost**: Under $5/month

### Deployment Files Created
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- ✅ `server/package.json` - Backend dependencies
- ✅ Environment configurations
- ✅ Build scripts and configurations

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### Features Tested
- ✅ News collection from all sources
- ✅ Article selection and deduplication
- ✅ Summary generation (mock AI working)
